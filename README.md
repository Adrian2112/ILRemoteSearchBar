#ILRemoteSearchBar

A UISearchBar subclass that observes the search field on a given frequency.

This is meant to be used to query a remote server after the text on search field is changed without firing the search for each character typed.
                    
The search field fires the delegate method after the user stops writing for an specified time interval.

##Usage

Install with [cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org/)

```
pod 'ILRemoteSearchBar'
```


Make your view controller conforms to `ILRemoteSearchBarDelegate` protocol

```objective-c
@interface ILViewController () <ILRemoteSearchBarDelegate>

```

Set the search bars delegate to your view controller
(programatically with the viewDidLoad or via interface builder)

```objective-c
ILRemoteSearchBar *searchBar = [[ILRemoteSearchBar alloc] ...];

searchBar.delegate = self;
```

Add the remoteSearchBar:textDidChange: method to your view controller and call your API from there

```objective-c
# pragma mark - ILRemoteSearchBarDelegate

- (void)remoteSearchBar:(ILRemoteSearchBar *)searchBar
          textDidChange:(NSString *)searchText
{
	// call your api
}

```

You can even conform to `UISearchBarDelegate` and receive the delegate
methods for your `ILRemoteSearchBar`

###Warning
If your view controller is conforming to the UISearchBarDelegate the
`searchBar:TextDidChange:` will be called when your `ILRemoteSearchBar`
text is changed as `ILRemoteSearchBar` is a subclass of `UISearchBar`
so make sure to check that the sender object is not your `ILRemoteSearchBar`

```objective-c
-(void)searchBar:(UISearchBar *)searchBar
		textDidChange:(NSString *)searchText
{
  if (searchBar != self.myRemoteSearchBar) {
    // do your thing
  }
}
```

## Configuration
You can change the time interval to wait before the delegate method is called with

```objective-c
searchBar.timeToWait = 0.5; // 0.5 is the default value
```
